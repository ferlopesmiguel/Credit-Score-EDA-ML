# Credit Scoring Analysis and Modeling

This project aims to analyze the credit score of various clients and develop a machine learning model to predict the credit score for new clients. The dataset used contains information about different variables related to the clients, such as age, income, credit history, among others.

## Project Content

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explored the main characteristics of the dataset, such as variable distributions, presence of missing values, correlations between variables, among others.
   - Used graphs and descriptive statistics to understand the relationship between variables and identify possible insights.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Created graphs to visualize the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and trends in the data.
   - Analyzed the relationship between variables using scatter plots, boxplots, and histograms.

3. **Statistical Tests:**
   - Conducted statistical tests to verify the significance of some relationships between variables.
   - Formulated null hypotheses and used appropriate statistical techniques to test them.

4. **Machine Learning Modeling:**
   - Developed a machine learning model to predict the credit score for new clients.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained the model using different algorithms, and evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics.

  ##Tha data and machine learning model development part of this project was inspired by the machine learning training provided by Hashtah Treinamentos, an online platform offering comprehensive courses on data science and machine learning.
